# bash_related
a repo about bash commands, installations and such

This script was an attempt to take care of all the cumversome steps every time a new machine (Linux) is used to work on a python project. 
Installing various libraries, and etc... updating installing git, pip, etc.

so, script runs, after user name and password input installs everything and alerts the user by max volume of the system :)
